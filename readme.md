This paper is a list of tips and resources that can empower your skills to write a talk and to be a better speaker and talk to the public.

This is based from the experience of Daniele Scasciafratte with the amazing help of the Mozilla Tech Speaker program (and a lot of books).

That material will be used also to create a talk to help teach beginners, and those looking to improve their skills, how to deliver a professional technical presentation: [http://mte90.github.io/Talk-HowTalk/#/](http://mte90.github.io/Talk-HowTalk/#/)
