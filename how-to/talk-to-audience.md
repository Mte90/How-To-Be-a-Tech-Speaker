## How to talk to the audience

If you never talk to an audience the first issue is:

* I have no idea where to start
* I am not a good speaker
* I am afraid of the public
* I have nothing interesting to say 

How to fight these thoughts?

* Take inspiration from others!
    * Pretty simple looks others talks also of different topics. Also, interview of famous actors to understand that is no so very difficult.
See on Ted as example or on YouTube for talks.
* Start with a simple and tiny goal, step by step!
    * As example draft a presentation and try it in your room
* Be positive of your talk! Without this everything that you will do in your life will be a mess.
    * Don’t start with excuse because people don’t like them. They are here to listen about your topic!
* Practice is the way, also with taking time and recording
    * On a long way see your recordings is the best way to see where you have to improve
* Fear of the public is helpful to do better
    * Fear is a way to enforce in us to fight it, to do what we want
* Don’t memorize but practicing is better for your "show"
    * Memory is for poetry, you need to speak with your feelings
* Take your time before to start to reorder your thoughts and be more fluid
    * Usually prepare a schema of your points for the slide that will be your talk path
* Take confidence with the topic of course! I don’t want listen someone talks about something that he doesn’t know because I am losing my time.
    * People go to the event to listen you, give to them something that deserve their time
* The topics are better when came from your personal background
    * As the previous point every topic that is personal is better to give more thrustness about what you are saying
* Put examples in your talk because everyone can follow them and are very attractive and easy to explain
    * It is demonstrated that story, jokes, graphs and image can be helpful example to let people remember easily your point
* If you have no idea where to start:
    * Use a question or a quote
    * With an image
    * With stats
* Details improve the quality of your talk
    * With the personal experience 
    * With strange situations that can be hilarious or easy to explain and get to the point
    * Statistics are objective and very easy to understand
* Why you are here, you are a human and people want to know why are you here
    * Again personal experience do the difference
* First issues about the topic and how to resolve them
    * People go to events to learn how to do better or discover new things
* Be part of the public
    * Say what the people want to listen and understand your audience
* Check your tone voice, don’t be at the same level or will be boring for the audience
* Eye contact is important, there are different ways
    * Look for a far away point in the middle of the audience
    * Look specific people that are interested
* Don’t give never your back to the audience
* Your posture need to be relaxed and confident
* When you want to do comparison about stereotypes or experiences never generalize to avoid issues with people that fit in that only for a part and avoid conflicts

Don’t forget that every discussion as 4 points:

* Persuade
* Inform
* Convince
* Entertain

If your talk or discussion has all the points will be probably an amazing experience for the audience!

These points are not mandatory but helpful on to get ready and draft your talk.

Your backup sentences in case of issues:
* If your joke falls, say "Pretend it was serious"
* If you lose your train of thought: "Sometimes silence says a lot, but not this time" or ask to the audience "What I was saying?" when someone reminds you "Oh cool, somene was listening"
* If the room is too hot say a joke abou the thermostats melted and you cannot change it or if it is cold you can saw that you saw few pinguins around that want to follow the presentation
* A big noise outside the room "That's what we do to people who try to escaper my talk"
