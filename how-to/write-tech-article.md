# How to write a tech article

Every tech speaker sooner or later will write a tech article or manage the personal blog.

Let’s see what are the best rules for this task (helpful also on the preparation of a talk).

* The title need to be intrigue
    * If you have no idea use a title generator like [http://www.title-generator.com/index.php/best-online-title-generator.html](http://www.title-generator.com/index.php/best-online-title-generator.html) 
* Start with a question, an image or with stats
* Start the paragraph with the important topic and later explain
* Divide the content into paragraph to avoid the "text wall effect"
* Break the line when a specific point was completed
    * It is helpful to avoid repetition
    * On the same block is the same concept
* Conclude with a strong image to enforce your point (meme usually are the best option)
* What is the purpose of the article? 
* Order the information using this schema:
    * 1st point:
        * Start with the same knowledge ground of the reader, example: your topic is about a new javascript library, the reader probably know does not have idea about what do so is better start to do an explanation about what was required to do before the arrive of this library
        * Put at the top the important things to explain later
        * Start with a simple example or point to be comfortable to the audience
    * 2nd point
        * Talk about news, details or with advanced view
    * 5th W order
        * 1st point
            * What, When, Where
        * 2nd point
            * Why, How

* When you want to do a reference about something already written few lines above do a little excerpt of that to avoid to the reader to lost the reading point
* Every item of a list need to start with a different word
* Avoid text block with a lot of text, better to split
* Metaphor or analogies are more easily remembered by the reader, especially at the top
* When you are using a technical term explain it on the first use
* Be original with your content!
    * An example can be to start from the conclusion and explain with the content. In that way the reader already know what will be the focus and can be more interested
* Every text need to explain at maximum only 3 ideas and develop the content around it
    * 3 ideas are enough because the reader will be more easily remember
* Remove the excessive stuff that are not important for your content
* Put "Sources" or external link improve the quality of the content (and a bit the SEO)
* Don’t forget to ask feedback on the content
* Don’t forget that you are writing to inform the reader, so what is missing to him to understand the content?
* The use of paragraphs let to do a brainstorming based on these blocks, and every block is helpful to arrive to the conclusion
* Don’t forget that example case are very easy to remember to the reader
