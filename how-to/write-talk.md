# How to write a talk

* Don’t forget to talk about yourself, you are the guru for that topic for the attendee
* Usually the first 5 minutes are very important because will let to the audience to understand if the talk will be interesting or not
    * So an introduction of the topic can be very important
* Show a concrete example/way to fix a statement
* Be specific when you can and generic to be more serious on what you are saying
* Identify the problems of your proposal
* Start every slide with the important part of the content (it will be easier to remember)
* Think about the audience skills
* Identify as a person with that problem, what do you want to listen?
    * What you are trying to promote
    * The topic points focused simply
* Understand the mindset of the technology you are talking
    * Flames are not very good during a live talk
* Create in your mind a boilerplate version that follow the slides and an advanced version, to use for an audience with more skills where you can use the slides as reference to explain more deeply
* You are not a teacher, you are a person with experience in that topic and you want to show your experience
* Simplify it’s important but not forget that sometimes it’s not the best way, but you can divide the topic into different slides
* The people can forget the focus so act like a showman to gather the attention from them
    * Funny images (I am addicted of GIF animated or meme)
    * Quotes are difficult to remember or to understand from an audience that don’t know that quote
* When you write a new talk try to understand if the slides order is right or you are missing something
* The practice is very important
* The title talk need to be interesting and curious
    * Use a title generator to gather inspiration
* Empathize few words help to send a message
* The slides need to be useful also without see the talk itself or remember it
    * Many slides with only images in that case are not very useful
* Last slide for question with your data like email and a link to see the slides
    * I also have a page with the list of all my talks, in that way they can find also other things

## Improve the talk

* A talk without improvements it’s not a good talk
* The world evolves with new tech stuff and things so it’s important to update it
* If you get often the same questions in your talk, add that information in the talk itself
* The slides cannot change but the way you explain the things can change based from the audience
* Improve the examples, often they need to be updated because as example after a year it’s not working anymore

## Tips

* The talk need to be done in stand up
* No stop words like ehm uhm but in that case stay silent
    * To exercise talk about something for 30 seconds and register it and listening. Repeat until you will stop to say it. 
Do it for different objects for weeks every day, this can help you to speed up on make phrases on your mind.
    * You need to see on recordings when you are saying them, in that way you can prevent them, is difficult but on the long way you see the effect
* Try to do the talk before the talk itself
* Check all the slides and the content before the talk itself
* Arrive in the room 30 minutes before your talk to check if everything is fine
